# Repository for Kaggle Notebooks

To be honest, we do not like Kaggle.

It is a place full of misleading and irrelevant content (including ours). We think it is overrated by the community. Yet, there are some worth reading notebooks and some hands-on datasets for learners to play around with. In this repository, we put our work here as a backup and record our learning progress.
