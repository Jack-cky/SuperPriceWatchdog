Without customers, no company can survive in the fast-paced business environment. That is the reason many organisations are building relationships with their customers. As part of Customer Relationship Management, retaining existing customers not only keep their engagement but also increases their loyalty to the company.\n\nA customer is classified as churned if one did not use the company's offering for a certain period. In a given period, the penetration of churned customers to the total number of customers is considered as customer churn rate. The churn rate is often used as a Key Performance Indicator for monitoring business performance. The lower the better customer retention (sometimes used to evaluate customer loyalty).\n\nCompanies may consider sending Electronic Direct Messages or discount vouchers to customers for avoiding the churn rate increment. Sending these marketing promotions to all the existing customers would be the best option to engage customers, and seems to predict customer churn does not have any obvious effect on it. Sometimes, however, these actions take costs. As a business strategist, balancing or increasing Return on Investment is the major task. If we could find customers who intend to stop the services, targeting customers at high risk of churn can reduce unnecessary resources on other customers while attracting customers at high risk of churn to re-engage with the company's offerings.\n\nThis notebook will implement customer churn prediction on a Telco and explain the rationale behind each step.\n\nIf you liked this notebook, consider upvoting. Your upvote does encourage us to work more on it. Also, appreciate it if you could leave a comment on the work for improvement.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import Dependencies\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport ast\nfrom time import time\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import recall_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nnp.random.seed(852)\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-12T12:47:04.285159Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-12T12:47:04.285641Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-12T12:47:05.999147Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-09-12T12:47:04.285551Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-12T12:47:05.997929Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Telco Customer Data Loading\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"file_name = \"WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv\"\ndf = pd.read_csv(f\"../input/telco-customer-churn/{file_name}\")\n\nnrow, ncol = df.shape\nprint(f\"File `{file_name}` has {ncol:,} columns with {nrow:,} rows.\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-12T12:47:06.002293Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-12T12:47:06.002806Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-12T12:47:06.065475Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-09-12T12:47:06.002757Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-12T12:47:06.064342Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"desc_dtype = df.dtypes\ndesc_iqr = df.describe() \\\n    .T[[\"min\", \"25%\", \"50%\", \"75%\", \"max\"]] \\\n    .astype(str) \\\n    .apply(list, axis=1)\ndesc_uniq = df.select_dtypes(include=\"object\") \\\n    .apply(pd.Series.unique)\n\ndesc = pd.concat([desc_iqr, desc_uniq])\ndesc = pd.concat([desc_dtype, desc], axis=1)\ndesc.columns = [\"data type\", \"description\"]\ndesc.index.name = \"column name\"\n\ndesc = desc.reset_index() \\\n    .groupby([\"data type\", \"column name\"])[\"description\"] \\\n    .apply(list)\n\ndisplay(desc)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-12T12:47:06.066539Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-12T12:47:06.066905Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-12T12:47:06.137193Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-09-12T12:47:06.066862Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-12T12:47:06.135825Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before we dive into the prediction, it is worthwhile to check out the data we got from an external source.\n\nThe dataset contains 7,043 customers with 21 attributes.
